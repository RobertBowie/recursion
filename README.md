# recursion
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was completed as part of a pair.  The aim of the project was to explore the use of recursion while reimplementing the following native javascript and DOM method polyfills:

- getElementByClassName()
- parseJSON()
- stringifyJSON()

### Testing

Tests were made with the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) testing framework.
Test are located in the ./spec directory. To run the Just open the spec runner file with chrome.
